in this class we can learn how to code with python languagae and do some pull and push on the git hub side.



first change will be: git init it will connect to the git hub account using terminal

the second change will be: git status, I can use this comment to see my changes or what I created.

3) git add . - and I can use add this changes to staging areas

4) git commit -m "here you can leave your description what u created or any changges"



max is a funciton to find the biggist number in a list of number
it is used like this: print(max("insert))


slicing example: [0:5]

word = 'Hello world!'
print(word)

# Corrected initialization of megalist with an empty dictionary
megalist = [{'name': None}]

wordsplited = word[0:5]  # Assuming you want the first 5 characters of 'Hello'
megalist.append(wordsplited)

print(megalist)




The replace() method in Python is used to replace occurrences of a specified substring with another substring. Here's a basic example:

python
Copy code
original_string = "Hello, world!"
new_string = original_string.replace("world", "there")

print("Original String:", original_string)
print("Modified String:", new_string)
In this example, the replace() method replaces the substring "world" with "there" in the original_string.

If you want to replace all occurrences of a substring, you can provide an optional third argument to replace(), specifying the maximum number of occurrences to replace. If omitted, it will replace all occurrences:

python
Copy code
original_string = "Hello, world! Hello, world!"
new_string = original_string.replace("world", "there", 1)

print("Original String:", original_string)
print("Modified String:", new_string)
Here, only the first occurrence of "world" is replaced with "there".

Remember that strings in Python are immutable, so the replace() method doesn't modify the original string but creates a new string with the replacements

some code: string = 'hello world'
now = string.split()
one = now[0] 
two = now[1]
now3 = one + " " + two
new = list(now3)
print(new)
done = 0
listo = 0
while listo < len(new):
    if new[listo] == 'o':
        new[listo] = 'a'
    else:
        listo += 1
print(new)

final = ''.join(new)
print(final)




Creation:

python
Copy code
my_dict = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2", "key3": "value3"}
Accessing Values:

python
Copy code
print(my_dict["key2"])  # Output: value2
Adding or Modifying Entries:

python
Copy code
my_dict["key4"] = "value4"
my_dict["key1"] = "new_value1"
Removing Entries:

python
Copy code
del my_dict["key3"]
Checking if a Key Exists:

python
Copy code
if "key2" in my_dict:
    print("Key 'key2' exists!"
          

          The sort() method is a built-in method in Python that sorts the elements of a list in-place, meaning it modifies the original list.

After calling reverselist.sort(), the elements in reverselist will be arranged in ascending numerical or lexicographical order, depending on the data type of the elements.

For example, if reverselist is initially [9, 4, 6, 1, 3, 0, 2, 7, 8, 5], after reverselist.sort(), it will become [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
